# CRTBPNaturalMotion

Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP)NaturalMotion is a package for computing periodic orbits and they're associated stable/unstable invariant manifolds, as well as performing various analyses in the CRTBP model assuming only natural motion (i.e., no control). The package also provides an interface for querying CRTBP periodic orbits in JPL's Poincare Catalog of Period Orbits.
